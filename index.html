            <p>Welcome to my site! I am a programmer, and this will be 
            a testing ground for a number of my school and personal
            projects. If you're here for copywriting, you can find samples and 
            pricing in the Copywriting page. If you want a better glimpse of my
            writing style, you can look at my Blog page for articles and galleries.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I write mainly about my two areas of focus; music (composition, production) 
            and technology (consumer electronics, programming). I love to learn, grow, 
            and write, so you'll find a lot of that in the blog section.
