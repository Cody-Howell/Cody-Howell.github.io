    <h1>Music Randomizer</h1>
    <p>This is the intro page for the Music Randomizer!</p>
    <p>A quick explanation for what you see on the page below you: 
      <ul>
        <li>Request (Red Box): The input box lets you write and play a space-separated list of labels (AA, AB)
          without having to worry about the randomizer. Once you get going, the nodes that have been played
          will be listed beneath that box. </li>
        <li>Graph View (Green Box): This box has the Begin and Stop buttons at the top, a selector to switch between different webs
          (read below), and the graph overview of the web. </li>
        <li>Next (Blue Box): This shows what is currently being played at the top, some Complex Web information (not explained
          in this document), what node is next, and other options the computer didn't play this time.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>There are 3 webs for you to experiment with: 
      <ul>
        <li>Web 1: A linear web with a 5-10 minute playtime.</li>
        <li>Web 2: A looping web with around 40 nodes and 5 starting points.</li>
        <li>Web 3: A very small looping web with 8 nodes and 2 starting points.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
