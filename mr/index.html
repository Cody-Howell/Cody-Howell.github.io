    <p class="BlueBox">Last Updated: 6/27/23<br>
      V 1.0.2 - Added details after beginning a playthrough. Implemented first web, redid audio for webs 1 and 3. <br>
      V 1.0.0 - Made a dropdown and adjust file structure to allow for easy switching between webs. Option changing is not very robust; be nice! Refresh as often as needed.<br>
      V 0.9.4 - Framework now changes colors, correctly identifies start nodes and puts them back after color changes, and removed detail container. <br>
      V 0.9.0 - Created Vis Framework nodes, adjusted codebase to simply show the debug, moved items around.<br>
      V 0.8.1 - Adjusted nodes for Sea Shanty due to always getting caught in their loops, added link to sheet music
      and image of web for sharing.<br>
      V 0.8 - 34 audio clips (missing AW on my first pass), a complete loop. Correctly chooses random start nodes. Files
      have an extra ~0.5 seconds of tail to reduce silence.<br>
